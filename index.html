                            Window cleaning is not a job that should be attempted by the inexperienced. Windows can be very streaky and difficult to clean if the correct tools and equipment are not used. You will need a squeegee, some window cleaner, a spray bottle, and a chamois cloth to clean windows quickly and efficiently.

                            Ensure to rinse off your squeegee after each stroke, or streaks will form on the window. Spray your window cleaner onto the pane and wipe it with the squeegee in smooth strokes. Finish up by spraying down the window frame and wiping it with the chamois cloth to remove any excess liquid. Enjoy your sparkling clean windows!
